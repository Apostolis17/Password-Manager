        -update_password
        -remove_password
        -display_password
2. Decide on master_password
    -Will you ask for one or not?
    -How will you generate the master password
    -How will you be able to ensure your master password, and the key generated are the same?
    -Will you need to generate a password every time, or just once?
    -Maybe, create the master password, and store in safely in the script.
3. Organize the display
    -Update menu.py
    -Google how to make terminal UI symmetrical/fancy
    -Contemplate Tkinter UI interface
