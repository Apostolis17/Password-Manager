    - run tests(see if works)
        -add_password
        -update_password
        -remove_password
        -display_password
2. Decide on master_password
    -Will you ask for one or not?
    -How will you generate the master password
    -How will you be able to ensure your master password, and the key generated are the same?
    -Will you need to generate a password every time, or just once?
    -Maybe, create the master password, and store in safely in the script.
3. Organize the display
    -Update menu.py
    -Google how to make terminal UI symmetrical/fancy
    -Contemplate Tkinter UI interface
4. Upload!
    -Post on /r/learnpython
        -Also on Python Enthusiasts Discord, Programmers Hangout
        -post on /r/ python, and /r/learnprogramming

STEPS TO TROUBLESHOOT
- We were inserting the encoded service value into the database.
- Inserting the string into the db still doesn't return the string
-       Because db_chek was checking the encoded version
-       The encoded strings are displayed 
-       Try encoding the service string, pass that to the db function/ Service still does
            not exist
- Check the data type the service is inserted into the db as 
- Check what data type the service is upon retrieval 
- Check what is happening upon db retrieval

-It is possible that the database takes a little bit to load in new addtions.
-That's why our services aren't being retrieved upon immediate addition
